# Handy-the-Human-Project

## Description

Methodology for a generic assistant that can provide avenues and information 
    regarding aspects of quality of life.

## Disclaimer from the author:

I'm a person who is self-studied for the majority of my coding experience and 
    am still growing my knowledge base.
    
Many examples/ideas that I may present are the result of being a spaztastic male
    veteran who was born and raised in the American Midwest. Please take the time
    to consider what a good equivalent for you would be. Potentially document that
    equivalent so that you can refer to it later.
    
My inspiration comes from a point of self-frustration and hope that others and the
    people I hold dear can benefit.
    
    Self-frustration because early in life, I avoided relying on others like the
        plague. This caused so much stress in my life and required some defining
        moments in order to change my ideology on the concept.
        
        There are also many things that were seemingly universal that many of my
        peers, including myself, were flabergasted that we didn't know anything
        about until later when we begun our adult life.
        
        An example I think many of my peers can relate with:
            Taxes 
            
    Hope that I can alleviate others of the same things that frustrate me and 
        impair my quality of life. I feel that if I struggle with something, there 
        is a liklihood is that somebody else struggles with it as well. 

Any particular generalization or claim may have had 5 minutes of google put into
    it. If it's of particular importance, I may create a works cited. Emphasis on
    'may'.

## Concept(s):

Data (has kept/is keeping/will keep) growing and advancing as time progresses. 
    There are many ways to (present/utilize/manipulate) this data

Whether the average person knows it or not, many things in life have a form of 
    data tied to it. Such as identification, manuals, legal precedence etc. 
    
    A good example would be your car:
        identification: VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)
        manuals: Owners manual
        legal precedence: local law
        
    These categories of data have a level of complication to them. I would venture
        to guess that many of us could very quickly determine what the VIN for our
        vehicle. 
        
        identification complexity:
            Purpose: To specifically id your vehicle 
            Example: 1234567890abcdefg (17 digit VIN)
            Complexity: "Simple"
            
        manuals complexity:
            purpose: An instructional booklet that is specific to your vehicle.
                can contain operational and maintenance information
            Example: A book or file of varying length
            Complexity: "Moderate"
                
        legal precedence complexity:
            purpose: to provide a groundwork and expectations for vehicle 
                operators and to cover a indredible variety of subjects related
                to legal driving.
            Example: of the 11 operating departments within The Department of 
                Transportation. Three are specifically designed for all things
                'road'.
            Complexity: "Advanced"
    
As you can imagine, not everyone needs an Advanced understanding of the intricasies
    and administration needs of government highway infrastructure. There is a 
    reason that we hire people like lawyers... the stuff is complicated and not
    always a clean cut interpretation of what the original intent of the law was.
    
However, the equality of access to information can make a huge impact on ones 
    quality of life. Further, the equality of access to QUALITY information about
    aspects of your life is equally important. 
    
Does everyone need to know everything, no.

Everyone needs to know what THEY NEED to know.

## Determining what people need to know

I'm going to take an Python based Object Oriented Programming approach to determining what a user needs to know.
    
### What "class" objects in my life are imperative to maintaining my quality of life?
    
#### Code example (1.0): 

    class House:
        pass

    class Car:
        pass
    
    class Smartphone:
        pass

### What are the "class attributes" that every one of these will share? Meaning to not have these attributes would make it something else

#### Code example (1.1): 

    class House:
        has_roof = True
        has_four_walls = True

    class Car:
        has_engine = True
        has_four_wheels = True
    
    class Smartphone:
        is_portable = True
        can_compute = True

### Well it's all well and good that a house has a roof, and a car has four wheels. What about these make them unique from other objects? Group what makes them different from other objects of the same class under what's called the 'dunder' (double underscore) init method. This creates an instance that's unique to our object.
        
#### Code example (1.2): 

    class House:
        has_roof = True
        has_four_walls = True
    
        def __init__(self, address, bedrooms, bathrooms)
            self.address = address
            self.bedrooms = bedrooms
            self.bathrooms = bathrooms

    class Car:
        has_engine = True
        has_four_wheels = True
    
        def __init__(self, make, model, vin)
            self.make = make
            self.model = model
            self.vin = vin
    
    class Smartphone:
        is_portable = True
        can_compute = True
    
        def __init__(self, brand, model, serial_number)
            self.brand = brand
            self.model = model
            self.serial_number = serial_number

### So we have a place for our information. Let's coordinate with our user on creating their House.

#### Code example (2.0): 

        class House:
            has_roof = True
            has_four_walls = True
    
            def __init__(self, address, bedrooms, bathrooms)
                self.address = address
                self.bedrooms = bedrooms
                self.bathrooms = bathrooms
        
        def awesome_user_interface():
            return username
        
        username_variable = awesome_user_interface()
        
        print(f'Welcome {username_variable}, you chose to create your House object, please input the following: ')
        
        address = input('\t What is the House address? ')
        
        bedrooms = input(\t How man bedrooms does your house have? ')
        
        bathrooms = input(\t How many bathrooms does your house have? ')
        
        UsersHouse = House(address,bedrooms,bathrooms)
        
## What now?

Obviously the code example is not all inclusive, but should give an indication of the direction this project is going. 

This is just a readme, please feel free to start with the Source package to start reading and folloing along with the code.
